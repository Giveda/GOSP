# Abstract  
Qt is an excellent C++ development framework, which provides excellent APIs. I love Qt very much, but I think that Qt is too large&complex(it needs a lot RAM/ROM), so I wrote this framework, named it GOSP. On the premise of not depending on Qt, this framework provides Qt-Style APIs, and it only needs a few hundred KB of ROM&RAM.  
  **By this product(GOSP), we pay tribute to Qt's outstanding contribution to the world.**   
Here is some applications(examples):

# 1. Description  
Qt is an excellent C++ development framework, which provides excellent APIs. I love Qt very much, but I think that Qt is too heavy(large, complex, and Qt needs a lot RAM/ROM), so I wrote this framework, named it GOSP.  
On the premise of respecting(not infringing) Qt's IPR(Intellectual Property Right), on the premise of not depending on Qt, this framework provides Qt-Style APIs, and it only needs a few hundred KB of ROM&RAM, so, GOSP is suitable for developing embedded software.  
  **2019-06-03, v1.0 was released, Codename is the Silent Blue Ghost.**    
  **I hope it can form a supplement to Qt, and wish it can be a member of Qt's ecosystem in the future.**
